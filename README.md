| A Gentle Introduction to GANs | Saturday, September 17th, 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM | Ever wondered about the how and why of GANs? We’ll be busting all the jargon surrounding GANs, and this easy-to-follow session will have you training your own GAN in no time! | Introduction to GANs, DCGAN | [Slides](Session_1/) | [Recording](https://youtu.be/7vP3iQWnLSc) |
| Are GANs all you need? | Sunday, September 18th, 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM | Ever wondered what makes GANs so powerful? In this session, there’ll be an overview of different GAN architectures and their capabilities in downstream tasks. | SRGAN, CycleGAN | [Slides](Session_2/) | [Recording](https://youtu.be/Kp2y5o_Jor8) |
| Do whatever you GAN | Thursday, September 22nd, 6:45 PM to 8:45 PM | We’ll be looking at a more specific application of GANs and building a model from scratch. We’ll also have you form teams with your peers, think about what GANs can do, and build a mini-project centered around it from scratch post-session. | DCGAN (From Scratch) | [Notebooks](Session_3/) | - |
